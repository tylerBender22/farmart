This is a mock sales system built with Java and SQL, designed with the intention to simulate real world sales operations, such as product management, transactions, and generating reports.
This system was written for Computer Science II demonstrating object-oriented programming and database managment.

A fixed test case is shown in "InvoiceReport.java".
